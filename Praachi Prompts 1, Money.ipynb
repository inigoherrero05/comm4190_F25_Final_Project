    "**tone slider and let user choose which message to send.**\n",

    "#### Phase 1: \"Input\" \n",
    "We are running STEP 1 of the 'Bill Reminder' workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your job in this step is ONLY to ask me the following questions,\n",
    "ONE AT A TIME, waiting for my answer each time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ask in this order:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. \"What draft message do you want to send about the bill?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2. \"Which specific bill is this (e.g., electric, WiFi, groceries)?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Ask for a WARMTH slider for Sam's tone:\n",
    "   \"On a scale from 1 to 5, how WARM should your message feel?\n",
    "    (1 = very cool/neutral, 3 = balanced, 5 = very warm/supportive).\"\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Ask for a LENGTH/DIRECTNESS slider for Sam's tone:\n",
    "   \"On a scale from 1 to 5, how LONG vs. BRIEF should your message be?\n",
    "    (1 = very brief/direct, 3 = medium, 5 = more detailed/softened).\"\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Confirm Nina's tone profile (preloaded from her profile and past analysis):\n",
    "   \"Nina's current tone profile is 'warm + brief' based on her past messages.\n",
    "    Does that still feel accurate to you? (yes/no, or suggest a small adjustment).\"\n",
    "\n",
    "6. \"Has there been any past tension or context around money or bills that I should know?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "7. \"What outcome do you want from this message (e.g., payment today, acknowledgment, gentle reminder)?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Rules:\n",
    "- Ask exactly ONE question per response.\n",
    "- Do NOT rewrite any messages.\n",
    "- Do NOT summarize.\n",
    "- After you have asked Question 7, append the text 'DONE ASKING QUESTIONS' at the end of your last message.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Phase 2: \"Creation\"\n",
    "Now run the 'Bill Reminder' rewrite step.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using all of the information above (my answers to your questions), do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Treat this as a 'Bill Reminder' topic with past outcomes tagged 'money/expenses'\n",
    "   that suggest softer, brief reminders usually work best with Nina.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Map my slider responses to a tone for Sam:\n",
    "   - WARMTH: 1–5 scale (1 = cool/neutral, 5 = very warm/supportive)\n",
    "   - LENGTH: 1–5 scale (1 = very brief/direct, 5 = more detailed/softened)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Use Nina's confirmed tone profile ('warm + brief', with any small adjustment I gave)\n",
    "   as the target tone for the delivered message.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Generate exactly 3 candidate rewrites of Sam's message.\n",
    "\n",
    "For EACH option, include the following fields in plain text (no JSON):\n",
    "\n",
    "Option 1:\n",
    "Message: \"...\"\n",
    "Tone match score (to my slider settings + Nina's profile): X/10\n",
    "Explanation: 1–2 sentences explaining why this option fits the sliders and Nina's tone.\n",
    "\n",
    "Option 2:\n",
    "Message: \"...\"\n",
    "Tone match score (to my slider settings + Nina's profile): X/10\n",
    "Explanation: ...\n",
    "\n",
    "Option 3:\n",
    "Message: \"...\"\n",
    "Tone match score (to my slider settings + Nina's profile): X/10\n",
    "Explanation: ...\n",
    "\n",
    "Constraints:\n",
    "- Message must be clear about which bill we mean.\n",
    "- Tone must be respectful and non-accusatory.\n",
    "- No guilt-tripping, sarcasm, or shaming.\n",
    "- The explanation should just describe tone fit and nothing else (no extra analysis, no simulation).\n",
    "\n",
    "Do NOT ask me any follow-up questions. Just present the three options as described.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Phase 3: \"Choice\"\n",
    "I have now chosen Option {option_choice} from the three options you presented.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the same context as before, and Nina's tones profile ('warm + brief'), do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Restate Option {option_choice}'s message in your own words so it is clear which one is being sent.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Simulate Nina's likely response, assuming:\n",
    "   - Her reply changes depending on what the emssage we sent was\n",
    "   - She is most receptive to responds the type of messages you have been told she responds best to\n",
    "   - She responds more favorably to texts that are more aligned with her preferences (i.e. she is more likely to send the payment)\n",
    "   - She will respond more warmly to warmer messages, unless she has strong vause to be apologetic\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Provide a short outcome summary for Sam, including:\n",
    "   - Whether the goal (payment + low tension) was achieved.\n",
    "   - How well Option {option_choice} aligned with:\n",
    "       (a) Sam's warmth + length slider settings\n",
    "       (b) Nina's 'warm + brief' tone profile.\n",
    "   - A single-sentence 'tone effectiveness note' for future reminders\n",
    "     (e.g., \"Warm openers + concise reminders continue to work well for Nina on money topics.\").\n",
    "\n",
    "Do NOT ask any further questions.\n",
    "Do NOT generate new options.\n",
    "Respond only with:\n",
    "- Nina's simulated reply\n",
    "- Outcome summary\n",
    "- Tone-effectiveness update"
