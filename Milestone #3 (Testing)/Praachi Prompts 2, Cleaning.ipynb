    "### Prompt Attempt 1\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Goal\n",
    "GOAL\n",
    "Create a fair, neutral, and non-annoying recurring cleaning schedule for Sam and Nina. \n",
    "Generate chore assignments and reminders that match each roommate’s tone preferences \n",
    "(Sam = direct, Nina = gentle/supportive).\n",
    "\n",
    "INSTRUCTIONS\n",
    "1. Report the current chore breakdown (or report NA if this is the first weekly chore checklist).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Then, ask me for:\n",
    "    * The new chore that needs rotation\n",
    "    * The task due date (i.e. do by Sunday morning)\n",
    "    * Whether or not the task alternates (Sam one week, then Nina the next)\n",
    "    * \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Use the feature for “Cleaning Schedule” to create a new task, as well as a \"fairness analysis\" feature that says what percentage of the work is done by each, based on rigor and time consumed (i.e. if Sam vacuums the floors and Nina wipes the table, that would not be even, despite them both doing one task and rigor does not line up.)\n",
    "4. Send a notification to the other roommate informing them that the checklist has updated and summarizing new responsibilities if needed. Use preexisting tone presets to do so. Ask this assignned member for their preferred reminder timing (date and time, one reminder or two). \n",
    "5.  Offer a soft follow-up message template in case a task is not completed on time. (The roommate who called this action may select whether or not they want to send it out.\n",
    "6.  Send an update notification to other roommate when the cleaning roomate marks task as done.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: \n",
    "1. Sam notices that the kitchen floor has been getting grimey. He knows that cleaning the kitchens weekly by Saturday afternoon is one of Nina's tasks and that the organizer says he is doing 60% of the work and she is doing 40%.\n",
    "2. He prompts HeyRoommate to create a new chore task for Nina to Swiff the kitchen floor weekly by Saturday morning. He also prompts HeyRoommate that the task should not alternate (it will remind Nina's task on a week-to-week basis).\n",
    "3. HeyRoomate creates this entry in the viewable checklist and updates the breakdown of chores.\n",
    "4. HeyRoommate then uses the tone it has for Nina (based on initial input and marginal changes due to successful and unsuccessful interactions) to send a message to Nina. her tone is \"warm + brief\". HeyRoommate sends a message to Nina saying \"You've got a new task! `Swiff the kitchen floor` by `Saturday Morning!` Your chore breakdown is now `47%`.\" When Nina clicks on this, she can input when she would like to be reminded. She asks to be reminded jut once per week, on Thursday at 4pm.\n",
    "5. On Thursday afternoon, HeyRoomate notes that Nina has not yet completed the task. Nina recieves the notification \"Time to shine! It's time to `Swiff the kitchen floor`!\" upon completing this task, Nina marks it as done on the checklist feature.\n",
    "6. HeyRoommate sends out a notification to Sam, whose tone is set as \"lightheated + longer\", The notification reads \"Wow! You could eat off these floors (but maybe don’t). `Nina` has completed task `Swiff the kitchen floor`!\""

    "**Learnings: kept getting stuck after one question!!**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Phase 1:\n",
    "GOAL\n",
    "Collect inputs needed to simulate a new cleaning schedule task.\n",
    "\n",
    "INSTRUCTIONS\n",
    "You must ask the user these three questions, ONE AT A TIME, in this order:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. \"What is the new chore that should be added?\"\n",
    "2. \"What is the due date? (for example: 'by Saturday morning')\"\n",
    "3. \"Should this task alternate between roommates, or stay with the same person every week?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Rules:\n",
    "- Ask exactly ONE question per response.\n",
    "- After asking a question, wait for the user's answer (do not ask the next one yet).\n",
    "- After you have received answers to all three questions, respond only with:\n",
    "  READY FOR SCENARIO SIMULATION\n",
    "- Do NOT simulate anything yet.\n",
    "- Do NOT restate the questions or add extra commentary once you output READY FOR SCENARIO SIMULATION.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Phase 2:\n",
    "Now run the full “Consistent Cleaning Schedule” scenario for this new task.\n",
    "\n",
    "You have already collected:\n",
    "- The new chore that should be added\n",
    "- The due date\n",
    "- Whether the task alternates or stays with one person\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume:\n",
    "- Roommates are Sam and Nina.\n",
    "- Sam is the one who initiated this new task.\n",
    "- Sam's tone preset: \"lighthearted + longer\".\n",
    "- Nina's tone preset: \"warm + brief\".\n",
    "- There is an existing weekly chore breakdown that you can invent in a reasonable way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Report the current weekly chore breakdown\n",
    "   - Include a brief list of existing chores and who does them.\n",
    "   - Include the current fairness split as percentages (e.g., Sam 60%, Nina 40%),\n",
    "     taking into account rigor and time (not just the number of tasks).\n",
    "   - If you have no prior context, you may invent a realistic breakdown.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Add the new chore using the user’s inputs:\n",
    "   - Use the new chore description.\n",
    "   - Use the due date they gave (e.g., \"by Saturday morning\").\n",
    "   - Follow the alternation rule: if the user said it alternates, set it to alternate\n",
    "     week-to-week between Sam and Nina; otherwise assign it to one roommate consistently.\n",
    "   - Update the checklist to include this new task.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Run a fairness analysis AFTER adding the new task:\n",
    "   - Recalculate the percentage of weekly work done by Sam vs Nina, based on rigor and time.\n",
    "   - Show both the BEFORE and AFTER percentages.\n",
    "   - If the workload is uneven by more than 10%, briefly note that this may need rebalancing.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Create and show the checklist entry for this new chore:\n",
    "   - Task name\n",
    "   - Assigned roommate for this week\n",
    "   - Due date\n",
    "   - Alternation rule (e.g., \"does not alternate\" or \"alternates weekly\")\n",
    "   - Updated fairness split (Sam %, Nina %)\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Send a notification to the assigned roommate:\n",
    "   - Use their tone preset:\n",
    "       * If Nina is assigned: tone = \"warm + brief\"\n",
    "       * If Sam is assigned: tone = \"lighthearted + longer\"\n",
    "   - The notification must include:\n",
    "       * The new task\n",
    "       * The due date\n",
    "       * Their updated chore percentage\n",
    "   - Then, invent their reply specifying:\n",
    "       * Their preferred reminder timing (day and time)\n",
    "       * Whether they want one reminder or two\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Generate a soft follow-up reminder template:\n",
    "   - This is what HeyRoommate could send if the task is not completed on time.\n",
    "   - Match the reminder tone to the assigned roommate’s preset and keep it gentle.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Simulate task completion and notify the other roommate:\n",
    "   - Assume the reminder is sent at the chosen time and the roommate eventually marks the task as done.\n",
    "   - Show a notification that HeyRoommate sends to the other roommate, in the other roommate’s tone preset, including:\n",
    "       * Who completed the task\n",
    "       * Which task it was\n",
    "       * A short, tone-appropriate comment (e.g., playful line for Sam, warmer for Nina).\n",
    "\n",
    "Output everything in clear sections:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Current Chore Breakdown (Before)\n",
    "- New Task Setup (from user inputs)\n",
    "- Fairness Analysis (Before vs After)\n",
    "- Checklist Entry\n",
    "- Notification to Assigned Roommate + Their Reply (reminder timing)\n",

    "   - Recalculate the percentage of weekly work done by Sam vs Nina, based on rigor and time.\n",

    "   - If the workload is uneven by more than 10%, briefly note that this may need rebalancing.\n",
