    "Nina and Sam share groceries and utilities, but conversations about splitting costs tend to get awkward or feel passive aggressive. In the past, Sam’s short, direct reminders have sounded cold, while Nina’s long explanations sometimes made Sam feel nagged. After a few tense exchanges, **HeyRoommate flags “financial discussions”** as a **high-sensitivity topic** for them.\n",
    "\n",
    "When Sam notices Nina hasn’t paid her half of the electric bill, he drafts a message that says, `“Can you Venmo me for your part of the bill? It’s been a week.”` HeyRoommate detects that this could come off as frustrated and suggests a gentler rewrite by adjusting Sam’s tone slider.* The app generates three options, one of which reads, `“Hey, just a quick reminder about the electric bill from last week — no rush, just making sure you saw it!”`\n",
    "\n",
    "Sam picks that version and sends it through the app. Once Nina replies positively and sends payment, HeyRoommate logs the outcome as a **positive resolution** and slightly adjusts Sam’s tone profile to reinforce that softer phrasing leads to better results with Nina.\n"

Each person gets reminders written in their own communication style — Sam’s are short and to the point, while Nina’s are softer and more encouraging. HeyRoommate also learns over time when each roommate responds best (for example, Nina in the mornings) and automatically adjusts when to send prompts.\n",
    "\n",
    "When it’s Nina’s turn, she gets a reminder like `“It’s your week for the bathroom — you’ve got this.”` Once she marks it complete, the app updates the shared log for both of them so Sam doesn’t have to remind her manually. This helps them stay accountable and avoid repeating the same argument every week.\n"
