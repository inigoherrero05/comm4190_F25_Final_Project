    "Our idea is to create a chatbot called ***HeyRoommate***: a communication helper for roommates and couples who live together. The app “translates” tense or emotional messages into tailored language that’s better suited to how your specific roommate communicates. For example, if you’re frustrated that `\"there have been dishes in the sink for the past week and it's driving me CRAZY\"` or want your roommate to `\"PLEASE keep it down at night because the noise is annoying\"`, *HeyRoommate* can rephrase your message based on tone settings like urgency or seriousness, and it’ll take into account your roommate’s personality preferences such as receptiveness, directness, or sensitivity. The user can also set profiles for each person in the house, so the chatbot can learn how to best get the message across. The goal is to prevent small issues from turning into larger conflicts and help people express themselves neutrally without losing their message."

    "**Core Functions:**\n",
    "* *Message rewriting:* Users input emotionally charged or sensitive messages. HeyRoommate rewrites them into calm, respectful, and effective phrasing based on user-chosen tone settings (e.g. urgency, seriousness, warmth).\n",
    "* *Profile-based adaptation:* Each roommate has a customizable profile that encodes their communication traits (e.g., direct vs. indirect, sensitive vs. analytical, formal vs. casual). The app learns these over time from feedback from the user, message success, and tone reactions.\n",
    "* *Contextual awareness:* HeyRoommate references past message outcomes and topics to improve future suggestions—similar to a personalized social memory.\n",
    "* *Conflict prevention analytics:* The system can flag potentially inflammatory wording or predict misunderstandings, then suggest “smoother” alternatives.\n",
    "* *Feedback and learning loop:* Users can rate whether the rephrased message “worked” (resolved the issue, received a positive response), allowing the model to refine user profiles continuously."

    "* Intent extraction: Identify the main topic (e.g., “noise complaint,” “move-out notice”) and conversational goals (“request,” “apology,” “boundary-setting”).\n",
