# HeyRoommate - Communicate Better
*Team members (alphabetical order by last name): Praachi Chakraborty, Íñigo Herrero Gómez-Lavín, Suya Que*

For this project, we as a team developed an application of an LLM (or LLMs) to a particular task or domain. Our application is called _HeyRoommate_.

_HeyRoommate_ is a communication helper for roommates and couples who live together. The app “translates” tense or emotional messages into tailored language that’s better suited to how your specific roommate communicates. You can also set profiles for each person in the house if you have multiple roommates. The goal of this application is to prevent small issues from turning into larger conflicts, keep them from feeling "personal," and help people express themselves clearly and neutrally without losing their message.

In this repository, you will find our iterations through [application ideas](https://github.com/inigoherrero05/comm4190_F25_Final_Project/tree/main/Milestone1_(Pitches)), [potential scenarios](https://github.com/inigoherrero05/comm4190_F25_Final_Project/tree/main/Milestone2_(Scenarios)), and [prompting development](https://github.com/inigoherrero05/comm4190_F25_Final_Project/tree/main/Milestone3_(Testing)) in the different folders. As well, this repository contains our [final workflow and its testing with multiple user scenarios](https://github.com/inigoherrero05/comm4190_F25_Final_Project/tree/main/Milestone5_(Workflow)).
