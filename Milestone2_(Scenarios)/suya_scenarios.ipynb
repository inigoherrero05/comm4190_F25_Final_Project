Alex opens HeyRoommate, selects “Overnight guests,” chooses a tone of calm + collaborative, and targets Sam’s profile (prefers direct but low-pressure requests). HeyRoommate rewrites Alex’s draft into a neutral, solution-oriented message that proposes specific limits and a check-in. Alex sends it through the app, which tracks delivery and (if enabled) recipient sentiment from Sam’s reply to learn what phrasing worked.\""
